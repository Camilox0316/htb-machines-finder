# HTB Machines Finder

## First Project â€“ Creating a Search Tool

### Introduction

Welcome to this project where I am learning Bash scriptin

### Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a search tool that mimics the functionality of the [HTB Machines Search](https://htbmachines.github.io/), but instead of being web-based, it will run directly from the console. This tool will help you quickly find information about HackTheBox machines based on various filters.

### Features of the Search Tool

1. **Machine Name Search**: Find machines by their names.
2. **IP-Based Search**: Retrieve information about a machine using its IP address.
3. **Operating System Filter**: Filter machines based on their operating systems.
4. **Certification Names**: Search machines associated with specific certifications.
5. **Difficulty Level**: Filter machines by their difficulty levels.
6. **Techniques Used**: Search for machines based on the techniques employed.

### What I am learning creating this tool

- Gain a deeper understanding of Bash scripting.
- Learn how to handle and process command-line input.
- Develop skills to manipulate and search through data efficiently.
- Create a practical tool that can be used to enhance your productivity.

### Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of Bash commands and scripting. We will build the search tool step-by-step, focusing on each feature individually. 

Good luck and let's get started on creating a powerful search tool in Bash!
